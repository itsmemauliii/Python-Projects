# Pandas Basics 🚀  

A beginner-friendly project to explore the fundamental capabilities of **Pandas**, one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis and manipulation.  

## Features 🛠️  
- Create structured data using Pandas DataFrames.  
- Perform data exploration and summarization.  
- Add, filter, and group data for meaningful insights.  

## Getting Started 🚦
