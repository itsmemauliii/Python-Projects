# 🔮 Horoscope Generator  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a simple **Horoscope Generator** built with Python. Users can input their **zodiac sign** to receive a random daily horoscope message. It’s a fun, beginner-friendly project to practice Python concepts like **dictionaries**, **lists**, and the **random module**.
