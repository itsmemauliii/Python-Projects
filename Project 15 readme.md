## Customizing SMTP Settings

Currently, the app uses Gmail's SMTP server. To use another email provider, update the following lines in the `send_email` function:
```python
with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
```
Replace `"smtp.gmail.com"` and `587` with the SMTP server and port of your email provider.

## Security Note

- The app does **not** store your email credentials. However, to avoid sharing your primary account credentials, consider generating an **App Password** for Gmail.
- For more information on App Passwords, refer to [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
