## 🧠 What I Learned
Through these challenges, I strengthened my understanding of:
- **Control Flow**: Writing clean `if/elif/else` statements to control the program’s behavior.
- **Logical Operators**: Using `and`, `or`, and conditions efficiently.
- **User Input**: Interacting with users using `input()` for dynamic responses.
- **Randomization**: Generating random values with the `random` module to simulate real-world behavior.

## 🔍 Challenge Descriptions

1. **Food Ratings ⭐**  
   - A program that rates food using a five-star system.  
   - Output ranges from *"Extraordinary"* to *"Poor"* based on user input.

2. **High School Grades 🎓**  
   - A system that classifies students into Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior based on their grade.

3. **Snapple Facts 🦉**  
   - A fun fact generator that uses random numbers to display quirky facts.

4. **Seasons of the Year 🗓**  
   - A program that tells users the current season based on their month input.

5. **Planet Weights 🪐**  
   - A weight conversion calculator that computes a person’s weight on different planets based on gravity.

## 💻 How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/control-flow-challenges.git
   cd control-flow-challenges
   ```
2. Run each challenge file with Python:
   ```bash
   python challenge1_food_ratings.py
   python challenge2_high_school_grades.py
   python challenge3_snapple_facts.py
   python challenge4_seasons.py
   python challenge5_planet_weights.py
   ```

## 🚀 Future Goals
- Apply control flow concepts to **larger projects**.  
- Explore **functions** and **loops** to make programs more efficient.  
- Solve more coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars.
